## ✨ Why I Built This
I’ve always loved rainy days — they make me feel calm, grounded, and focused (sometimes sleepy as well). I wanted to capture that feeling in a productivity tool that feels less like a to-do list and more like a friend quietly cheering me on 🌧️🍃

Also, I needed an excuse to mess around with audio controls and timing functions in JavaScript hehe 🌀

Pull requests and feedback are always welcome 🫶🏻

Umm, actually I messed with the CSS here and there just to make it look better on mobile… kinda hacked my way through it 😅 Might review and clean the code later.
